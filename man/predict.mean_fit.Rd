\title{Predicts arithmetic mean and provides prediction weights if required.}
\usage{
\method{predict}{mean_fit}(mean_fit, x, y, xnew = NULL, weights = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean_fit}{Output of \code{\link{mean_fit}}}

\item{x}{Covariate matrix of training sample}

\item{y}{Vector of outcomes of training sample}

\item{xnew}{Covariate matrix of test sample}

\item{weights}{If TRUE, weights underlying the prediction for xnew calculated}
}
\value{
Returns list containing:
\item{prediction}{vector of predictions for xnew}
\item{weights}{If \code{weights=TRUE} prediction weights of dimension \code{nrow(xnew)} x \code{nrow(x)} 
containing the weights that deliver predictions where each row gives the weight that each training 
outcome received in the prediction for xnew.}
