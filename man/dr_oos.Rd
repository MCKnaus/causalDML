\arguments{
\item{y}{Numerical vector containing the outcome variable.}

\item{w}{Treatment vector. Provide as factor to control ordering of the treatments,
otherwise program orders treatments in ascending order or alphabetically.}

\item{x}{Covariate matrix.}

\item{xnew}{Covariate matrix of test sample.}

\item{ml_w}{List of methods to be used in ensemble estimation of propensity score.
Methods can be created by \code{\link{create_method}}. Default is an untuned honest
\code{\link{regression_forest}}.}

\item{ml_y}{List of methods to be used in ensemble estimation of outcome regression.
Methods can be created by \code{\link{create_method}}. Default is an untuned honest
\code{\link{regression_forest}}.}

\item{ml_tau}{List of methods to be used in ensemble estimation of CATEs.
Methods can be created by \code{\link{create_method}}. Default is an untuned honest
\code{\link{regression_forest}}.}

\item{cf_mat}{Optional logical matrix with k columns of indicators representing the different folds
(for example created by \code{\link{prep_cf_mat}}). Otherwise created internally.}

\item{compare_all}{Relevant multiple treatments: If FALSE, only comparisons to first treatment considered.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of folds used in cross-validation of ensemble weights (default \code{nfolds=5}).}

\item{path}{Optional path to save the \code{\link{ensemble}} objects for later processing.
IATE objects saved in new subfolder Comparisonij where i is the index of the control and j of the treated group.}

\item{quiet}{If FALSE, ensemble estimators print method that is currently running.}
}
\value{
\item{cates}{Returns a n x number of comparisons matrix (one column in case of binary treatment)
containing the predicted CATEs.}
         \item{APO}{\code{\link{APO_dml}} object containing the underlying nuisance parameters etc.}
         \item{ATE}{\code{\link{ATE_dml}} object containing the underlying doubly robust score.}
}
\description{
This function produces out-of-sample predictions of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using the
DR-learner (Kennedy, 2020).
It executes steps 1 to 4 of algorithm 1 in Knaus (2020) as part of the \code{\link{dr_learner}}.
